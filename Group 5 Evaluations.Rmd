Hello! Please check your evaluations below based on your classmates and instructors. We advise you to come to office hours if specified. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
eval = read.csv("Group 5 Evaluations.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

**Below are evaluations from your classmates:**

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(plyr)
eval_num = eval[,1:4]
set.seed(10)
eval_num$extra = replicate(nrow(eval_num), sample(1:5, 1))
names(eval_num) = c("Timestamp", "Purpose communicated clearly?", "Presentation was done in a way that engaged audience?", "Organized and easy to follow?", "Extra")
num_questions = melt(eval_num, id="Timestamp")
names(num_questions) = c("Timestamp", "Questions", "Rating")
num_questions$Rating = as.factor(num_questions$Rating)

df_questions=ddply(num_questions,.(Questions),summarise,
              prop=(table(Rating)),
              Rating=names(table(Rating)))
df_questions = df_questions[df_questions$Questions!="Extra",]
df_questions$Rating = as.factor(df_questions$Rating)
df_questions$prop = as.numeric(df_questions$prop)
names(df_questions)[2] = "Frequency"

# Frequency Graph 
ggplot(df_questions,aes(x = Rating, y = Frequency,fill=Questions))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity",position='dodge') +
  theme(legend.direction = "vertical", legend.position = "bottom")
```

#### What did you like most about the presentation?

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} 
cat(paste('-', eval$What.did.you.like.most.about.the.presentation.), sep = '\n') 
```

#### What areas might you suggest for improvement not listed above?

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(paste('-', eval$What.areas.might.you.suggest.for.improvement.not.listed.above.), sep = '\n')
```

**Below are notes from your instructors:**

- Causes of death in the US 
- Non-chronic that causes death 
- Very good project and good motivation. I would be happy to discuss with you to clarify a few things regarding your project. Could you please come to one office hour to discuss it? Thanks!
